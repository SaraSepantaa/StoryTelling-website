        <h2>Purpose of the Film</h2>
        <p>
          <em>"Jahan Ba Man Beraghs" (Dance with Me)</em> is a poignant reminder
          that life, despite its flaws and fleeting existence, can be profoundly
          meaningful. It raises the film's central question:
          <strong
            >What is the value of life, especially when one is aware that it
            will end?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a narrative about embracing life to the fullest rather than
          dealing with mortality. Jahangir's fatal disease is only a prop in
          this film, serving as a backdrop for the relationships, connections,
          and shared experiences that give life purpose. This film encourages us
          to appreciate the simple pleasures in life, confront painful facts,
          and mend the bonds that truly matter.

      <!-- Key Concept Section -->

        <h2>Key Concept</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of joying in hard times, this film takes a different approach
          to discovering <strong>meaning</strong>. That meaning is sometimes
          accompanied by sorrow or happiness, but with the goal of taking us
          from one level to the next stronger. Those deeper things, especially
          when it feels as though life is reaching the end of its final chapter,
          are most important; in fact, at times it is actually closest to the
          end that he begins to acknowledge the meaning most clearly and
          strongly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>"Jahan Ba Man Beraghs"</em> looks at death in an entirely
          different manner: It does not highlight the tragic ending; it rather
          projects the ability of introspection, reunions, and self-realization
          that comes along with dying. It also reminds us that we can see life's
          meaning when we look from outside-the experiences and the
          relations-while going along in our journey of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          At inner definition, it goes,
          <strong
            >"Life, with all its messiness and beauty, only makes sense when we
            let ourselves feel."</strong
          >
          Well, perhaps the story would be of a struggling, silent, and strong
          endurance through the troubles of life. A gathering of people
          commemorating Jahangir's life does sometimes convey that even during
          the most gruesome events in life, at times, there is a moment for
          laughter, forgiveness, and reconnection to what is really important in
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          It actually nudges audiences to look inward into their own lives by
          the way the characters come to terms with their grief and differences.
          It tells one that meaning is not something to wait for-waiting to
          find-it is what we create and nourish throughout every relationship,
          moment, and decision.
