        <h2>Narrative Strategies in "Jahan Ba Man Beraghs"</h2>
        <p>
          Symbolism, non-linearity, and ambiguity: these three forms of
          storytelling in
          <em>"Jahan Ba Man Beraghs"</em> contribute much to broadening and
          complicating the narrative. Each is intended not simply to underline
          the themes which underlie the film but also to further increase the
          emotional involvement of viewers. Below this comes each strategy, with
          examples from the film, dedicating inquiry into its contribution to
          the shape of the story.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Symbolism Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Symbolism: Different Shades of Meaning</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Symbolism is conveying dimensions to
          objects, places, or characters beyond their literal use.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example from the Film:</strong> The villa of Jahangir is a
          source of isolation and acceptance. It is a place of nature that gives
          insights toward simple living and the hustle and bustle of the city.
          The red minibus also symbolizes the collective journey toward
          introspection, memories of life, and, most importantly, what people
          share.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Effect:</strong> These symbols broaden the narrative in terms
          of theme and subtext for the audience, detracting attention from the
          dialogue. The villa also becomes a venue, so to speak, of reflections
          and connections in untangling the knot that life may present.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Non-linearity Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Non-linearity: Exploring the Unpredictability of Life</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Non-linear storytelling is a switch in
          tone or time to represent the many complexities of life and the
          relatively unpredictable nature of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example from the Film:</strong> The film often takes a leap
          from humorous moments like playful jokes among friends to outstanding
          emotional depth like Jahangir's quiet reflections on his mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Effect:</strong> By breaking the narrative with varying tones,
          it leaves the viewers entailed emotionally. It gives the benefit of
          seeing themselves within the scope of the characters yet through these
          tonal changes depicting heaven and hell of life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Ambiguity Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Ambiguity: Living Life at Uncertainty</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Definition:</strong> Leaving some details of the storyline
          open-ended reflects the complexity and incompleteness of life in
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example from the Film:</strong> Jahangir's friend's unresolved
          conflicts still remain unfinished business by the end of the film-the
          unresolved resentments, unarticulated feelings. Such a choice is very
          intentional and can be related to the fact that not all relationships
          or feelings reach a closure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Effect:</strong> It invites the audience to bring their own
          perspective to the tale, rendering it highly subjective and relatable.
          It elevates the argument that life itself does not often neat
          conclusions and, therefore, encourages occupants to dwell with
          complexities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Conclusion Section -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Concluding Remarks: The Significance of these Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          It is a story about life and death, but it is because of the narrative
          strategies in
          <em>"Jahan Ba Man Beraghs"</em> that it has become a much deeper
          reflection on relationships, resilience, and meaning. That symbolism
          lets you peep deeper, non-linearity brings emotional realism, and
          ambiguity imitates the unresolved nature of life. Now you build a
          cinematic experience that lingers on a mind, long after the screen
          fades to black.
